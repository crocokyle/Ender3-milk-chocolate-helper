# Ender3-milk-chocolate-helper
Helps you perfectly temper milk chocolate on an Ender 3


# !! NEVER EXCEED 50°C ON THE PRINTER BED!!

*Make sure your room temperature is at or below 80°F. It will be very difficult to cool your chocolate properly otherwise*

**1. Start with a glass beaker of 110g milk chocolate. Place it on the printer bed at 45°C for an hour. Stir until fully melted and consistent.** \
    - If you read the surface temperature with an infrared thermometer, it should read ~ 103-104°F.\
    *Appearance: Inconsistent, thick, semi-gloss*
    
**2. Add 5 milk chocolate chips (required) and 5.46g of cocoa butter (optional). Mix vigorously until fully melted.** \
    - While mixing, reduce bed temperature to 26°C and continue to stir until the surface reaches ~82°F (takes about 1 hour)\
    *Appearance: Smooth, dull, thick viscosity*
    
**3. Increase the bed temperature to 33°C until surface reaches ~ 87-88°F. Hold the temperature here and continue mixing for 30 minutes.** \
    *Appearance: High Gloss, consistent, and have a pliable viscosity*
